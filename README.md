The study of information transfer and processing in complex systems has garnered significant interest across various fields. The understanding of how information flows within these systems holds implications for communication networks, biological systems, financial markets, and more. Several approaches, such as Transfer Entropy, Symbolic Transfer Entropy, and Log-Likelihood Ratio, have been proposed to measure and analyze information transfer. However, the suitability of these methods for complex systems is still a subject of debate, necessitating further exploration and development.

Additionally, the concept of information flow raises crucial questions concerning causality and the interplay between the past, present, and future. To address these questions, theories like Stochastic Optimal Control Theory and Feedback Capacity of Information Theory have emerged, exploring the interrelationship between control and information transfer. A deeper understanding of information transfer and processing in complex systems carries significant implications for various fields. Therefore, further research in this domain is essential to uncover new insights and advance knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.
